     * [Reference](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-binary-tree/discuss/106156/Java-worst-case-O(N)-solution)
     * Key points:
     *   1. Position of nodes should follows the positions in the array,
     *      e.g. [3,2,1,6,0,5], max = 6, so 3,2,1 should be on the left
     *           side of 6, and 0,5 should be on the right side;
     *   2. The logic flow is that
     *      2.1. If nums[i] is greater than the right-most node of deque,
     *           all nodes should be on the left side of node with val less 
     *           than nums[i]
     *      2.2. If nums[i] is less than the right-most node of deque, just
     *           need to assign them to the right of the right-most node
     *      2.3. Nodes relations are formed by such iteration
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(N). amortized time.
     * Space Complexity: O(N)
