     * Key points:
     *   1. Count nodes of subtree and sum them up;
     *   2. Get depth from the left subtree and get right subtree's depth,
     *      then compare them 
     *      2.1. If depth - 1 == right subtree's depth, which means right
     *           subtree also has some nodes on the last level, so we can
     *           assure that left subtree is full, for calculating the 
     *           number of nodes in the left subtree, we use 2^(n - 1), 
     *           which equals to 1 << n - 1, then recursively compute the 
     *           right subtree's #node 
     *      2.2. In the second case, we know that there is no node in the
     *           last level of right subtree, we can use 2^(n - 2) to 
     *           calculate the right subtree, then recursively calculate 
     *           the left subtree
     *   3. Since it is a complete BST, we can use left subtree to calculate
     *      depth.
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(logN * logN)
     * Space Complexity: O(h). h is the height of the tree
