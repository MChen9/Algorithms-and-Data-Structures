     * [Reference](https://leetcode.com/articles/unique-binary-search-trees/)
     * Key points:
     * 1. G(i) means the number of unique BST for input i;
     * 2. G(i) equals to the sum of all possible combinations of root 1...i;
     *    2.1. Combinations: #leftSubtree * #rightSubtree
     *    2.2. From base case, G[0] means empty tree, G[1] means has one node,
     *         to n
     * 3. G(n) = Sum F(i, n) = Sum G(i - 1) * G(n - i)
     *    3.1. F(i, n) means #unique BST of input n with root i
     * 4. Initialize int[n + 1] to include empty tree case.
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(N^2). Since sum i = (2 + n)(n - 1)/2
     * Space Complexity: O(N). Initialize a length (n + 1) array to store all
     * intermediate results
