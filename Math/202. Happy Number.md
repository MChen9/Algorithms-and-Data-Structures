     * Key points:
     *   1. If there is a cycle, then it is not a happy number
     *      1.1. Cycle means square sum of digits are the same, one way 
     *           to do this is initializing a hash set to store it
     *      1.2. Another way to save memory is doing it by slow and
     *           fast as like detecting linked list cycle
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(mlog_10(n)). n is the input number, m is
     * the number of getting square sum of digits
     * Space Complexity: O(1).
