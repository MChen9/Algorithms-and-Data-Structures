     * [Reference](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/solution/)
     * Key points:
     *   1. Corner case: if x < 0, it cannot be palindrome, if x is with 0 end 
     *      and it is not zero, it cannot be palindrome;
     *   2. Only compare half of x, do not need to consider overflow
     *      2.1. E.g. x = 1221, revNum = 1 -> 1 * 10 + 122 % 10 -> 12,
     *           x = 1221 -> 122 -> 12, x = revNum
     *   3. If input's length is odd, then x == revNum / 10, e.g. 12321
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(log_10(n)). Since x is divided by 10
     * Space Complexity: O(1).
