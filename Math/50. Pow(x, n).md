     * Key points:
     *   1. Corner case: if n == Integer.MIN_VALUE, then we need to 
     *      cast n before assigning it to a long variable;
     *   2. To save running time, we can divide n by 2, if n is odd,
     *      multiplicate one more time by ans *= x;
     *   3. If n is odd, ans *= x means store one more time for later
     *      use;
     *   4. x *= x means multiplicate themselves, e.g. 2^8 = 2^4 * 2^2 * 2^2;
     *   5. Bit manipulation:
     *      5.1. N & 1 means bit-wise AND operation, if N is odd, then it 
     *           will result in 1
     *      5.2. N >>= 1 means bit-wise signed right shift, N is divided by 2
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(log n). n is divided by 2
     * Space Complexity: O(1).
