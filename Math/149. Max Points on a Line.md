     * Key points:
     *   1. Corner case: if length <= 2, there must be one line of them;
     *   2. HashMap is for storing slopes and number of points other than i
     *      2.1. It is hard to determine precise of slope, so we just need
     *           to store the decimal format of the slope
     *      2.2. Rather than directly storing decimal format of the slope, 
     *           we should store denominator and numerator as a string for
     *           key of the map
     *      2.3. To have the decimal format of the slope, we need to have
     *           GCD of deltaX and deltaY
     *           2.3.1 GCD can handle negative pairs, e.g. [-1, 1] -> gcd = 1, 
     *                 [1, -1] -> gcd = 1, both have same final result [-1, 1];
     *   3. Calculating slopes goes from i to other points;
     *   4. If slopes are the same, then these three points are on the same
     *      line, so we use max to count the number of points other than i 
     *      itself;
     *   5. For every change of i, we have the number of points that are on
     *      the same line with i, but there may be some overlap points, so
     *      we use overlap to record it;
     *   6. locMax + overlap + 1 means that we need to add 1 to the final 
     *      result, since i itself have not been counted.
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(n^2). That results in 
     * (N - 1) + (N - 2) + .. + 1 = N(N - 1)/2 operations
     * Space Complexity: O(n).
