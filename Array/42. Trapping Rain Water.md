     * Similar to 11.Container With Most Water
     * Key points:
     *   1. The capacity of trapped water depends on the shorter bar;
     *   2. Image that the very begining bar and the last bar form a
     *      container, since bars between them are much shorter, then
     *      we can compute water as below
     *                leftMax = the height h1 of 1st bar
     *          trapWater = (leftMax - h2) + (leftMax - h3) + ... 
     *   3. max{leftMax, height[i]} can make sure that different leftMax
     *      can trap different capacity of water, then do a loop to sum
     *      up all the water in every sink.
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(n) 
     * Space Complexity: O(1)
