     * We can assume that k may be the celebrity in the first loop,
     * then before k, based on knows(), we know there must be someone
     * know those people, so they cannot be celebrity.
     * After k, knows(k, i) returns false, then i cannot be celebrity,
     * since everyone other than k knows celebrity.
     * Thus, based on the first loop, we can have a candidate, which 
     * may be celebrity.
     * One thing we can be sure is that people before k and after k 
     * must not be celebrity, since they know somebody or somebody 
     * does not know them, which violate the definition of celebrity.
