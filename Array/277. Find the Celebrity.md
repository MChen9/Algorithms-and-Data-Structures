     * The key point is knows().
     * This algorithm has nothing to do with adjacency matrix.
     * Key points:
     *   1. We can assume that k may be the celebrity in the first loop,
     *      then before k, based on knows(), we know there must be someone
     *      know those people, so they cannot be celebrity;
     *   2. After k, knows(k, i) returns false, then i cannot be celebrity,
     *      since everyone other than k knows celebrity;
     *   3. Thus, based on the first loop, we can have a candidate, which 
     *      may be celebrity;
     *   4. One thing we can be sure is that people before k and after k 
     *      must not be celebrity, since they know somebody or somebody 
     *      does not know them, which violate the definition of celebrity.
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(n) at most 2n steps assuming knows() is in O(1)
     * Space Complexity: O(1)
