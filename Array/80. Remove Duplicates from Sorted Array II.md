     * Key points:
     *   1. The value refered by p2 always compares to the value before 2 of p1, 
     *      which means we only consider duplicate more than twice.
     *      p1 and p2 apart only if values are the same in [p1 - 2, p2],
     *      so we do not need to worry that value of p1 has been changed
     *      before p1 - 2 arriving;
     *   2. If there are two same values before p1, p1 stay there, p2 goes to
     *      find different value, then compact diferent values after two same
     *      value.
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(n)
     * Space Complexity: O(1)
