# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures

This repository is for recording the study trace of [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/). Some contents are based on [UCBerkeley CS61B Spring2014](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/61b/) and [Fifty Must Know Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/wangzheng0822/algo?from=singlemessage&isappinstalled=0).

It will includes three aspects of solution
- Data structure
- Algorithm
- Time and space complexity
